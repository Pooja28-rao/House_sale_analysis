**House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**

This project involves predicting house prices based on various features
such as area, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors. The
goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to historical data in order
to forecast house prices, which can be useful for real estate investors,
home buyers, and sellers.

**Features**

-   **Area** (in square feet)

-   **Number of rooms**

-   **Year built**

-   **Location** (neighborhood)

-   **Lot size**

-   **Building type**

-   **Condition of the house**

-   And other factors like garage, basement, etc.

**Machine Learning Algorithms Used**

-   **Linear Regression**

-   **Decision Trees**

-   **Random Forest**

-   **XGBoost**

-   **CatBoost**
